# nlp-deeplearning.ai-coursera
In this repo, I'm sharing my solutions to the 4 courses of NLP specialization by deeplearning.ai in Coursera. The courses are:
C1) Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
C2) Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models
C3) Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models
C4) Natural Language Processing with Attention Models
I suggest you use this for reference only and try to solve the notebooks yourself.
